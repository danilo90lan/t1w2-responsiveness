            <p>Year three of a global pandemic. A war in Ukraine. Inflation in the U.S. at a 40-year high. Small talk around the watercooler
                (mainly the virtual one, nowadays) certainly feels heavier than it used to.
       
               Recent Gallup data indicates that in 2022, companies and managers remain 
               challenged by the task of raising employee engagement to pre-pandemic levels. 
               Nearly half of global workers (44%) surveyed reported feeling “a lot” of stress in the previous day. The Great Resignation 
               has demonstrated the power of employees to vote with their feet, and a resurgence of the labor movement in the U.S. has put 
               pressure on even top-tier companies to improve working conditions.</p>
